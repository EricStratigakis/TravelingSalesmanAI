To get the number of nodes we expecedt to generate \"E\" with a TSP of size n, it follows that E = 10^(slope*n).  This means that the larger the slope, the more nodes we expect to generate.\n",

However, the A* algorithm was optimized well enough that it was able to execute all the problems in reasonable time.  This is most likley the case since A* with h(n) = 0 was also able to execute all the problems in reasonable time."
