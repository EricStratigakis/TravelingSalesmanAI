# TravelingSalesmanAI

Used AI to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP).  In the first attempt, we use the A* algorithm to solve for the perfectly optimal solution to the problem.  Since the TSP is np hard, we run into runtime issues as the size of the problem increases.  In the second attempt, we use the hill climbing algorithm to solve the TSP.  This version wil find a near optimal solution in much less time.
